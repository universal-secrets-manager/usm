# ADR-0001: Use YAML for structure + encrypted values

## Context

We need a human-readable format for the secrets file that can also contain encrypted values.

## Decision

We will use YAML for the structure of the secrets file, with encrypted values stored as base64-encoded strings within a specific format.

## Consequences

- Pros: Human-readable, diffable, widely supported.
- Cons: Slightly more complex parsing logic.
