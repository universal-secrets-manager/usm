# ADR-0003: scrypt parameters and tunables

## Context

We need to decide on parameters for the scrypt key derivation function.

## Decision

We will use the following parameters for scrypt:
- N (CPU/Memory cost): 32768
- r (block size): 8
- p (parallelization): 1

These provide a good balance of security and performance for typical developer machines.

## Consequences

- Pros: Good security margin, reasonable performance.
- Cons: May be slow on very resource-constrained devices.
