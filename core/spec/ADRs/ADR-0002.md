# ADR-0002: X25519 + HKDF for envelope; Ed25519 for signatures

## Context

We need to decide on cryptographic algorithms for envelope encryption and file signing.

## Decision

- Use X25519 for key exchange and HKDF for key derivation in envelope encryption.
- Use Ed25519 for signing the secrets file.

## Consequences

- Pros: These are well-vetted, performant algorithms with good library support.
- Cons: None significant.
